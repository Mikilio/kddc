A wordplay in German sounding like “copy the docker volumes”.

This is a Nix Module starting a service that does just that. It's most suitable
to be used in servers running a lot of docker containers. (Just because Nix is
awesome does not mean OCI-Container are bad!)
Backups with Kopia are fast and reliable and the GUI allows for administration
by “non-tech-savvy” users as well.

If you found this repo you may have been searching for a long time.
Congrats!
